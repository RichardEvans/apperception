# The source code for *"Making sense of sensory input"*

## Installation instructions

You need to have installed Haskell and Clingo (version 4.5 or above).

1. To install Haskell:
    * go to https://www.haskell.org/downloads/

2. To install Clingo (version 4.5 or above):
    * go to https://potassco.org/clingo/

## Compilation instructions

Once you have Haskell and Clingo installed, just run (from the root directory):
   * `cd code`
   * `cabal update`
   * `cabal configure`
   * `cabal new-build`
   * `cabal install`
   * `cd ..`

## Simple Examples

Once the system is installed (see above), you are ready to try some examples.

To run these examples, **make sure you are in the root directory called apperception**.

A single sensor oscillating between on and off:
   * `~/.cabal/bin/solve misc predict_1.lp`

Two sensors, one oscillates between on and off, while the other has the same reading throughout:
   * `~/.cabal/bin/solve misc predict_2.lp`

Exogenous action:
   * `~/.cabal/bin/solve misc exog_1.lp`

Searching through templates of increasing complexity, looking for a unified interpretation:
   * `~/.cabal/bin/solve eca-general predict_eca_245_b3.lp`

## More Complex Examples

These examples take significantly longer to run than the simple examples above. There is a time-limit of 4 hours per template. 

ECA prediction:
`~/.cabal/bin/solve eca predict_110_b5_t14.lp`

ECA retrodiction:
`~/.cabal/bin/solve eca retrodict_110_b5_t14.lp`

ECA imputation:
`~/.cabal/bin/solve eca impute_110_b5_t14.lp`

The Seek Whence "theme song" babbbbbcbbdb...
`~/.cabal/bin/solve sw predict_3.lp`

Music prediction:
`~/.cabal/bin/solve music predict_IncyWincySpiderSmall.lp`

Rhythm prediction:
`~/.cabal/bin/solve rhythm predict_Mazurka.lp`

Binding prediction:
`~/.cabal/bin/solve binding predict_r2_b5.lp`

Occlusion:
`~/.cabal/bin/solve occlusion w1`

Mislabelled data (noise):
`~/.cabal/bin/solve mislabel predict_1_100_0_1.lp`

Fuzzy sequences:
`~/.cabal/bin/solve noisy 1 3 2`

Sokoban:
`~/.cabal/bin/solve sokoban e_8_17`

Sokoban from pixels:
`~/.cabal/bin/solve sok-pixels e_10_3`

In general, solve can be run with any file in the data directory.
The options are:
 * `~/.cabal/bin/solve eca <file in data/eca>`
 * `~/.cabal/bin/solve sw <file in data/sw>`
 * `~/.cabal/bin/solve music <file in data/music>`
 * `~/.cabal/bin/solve rhythm <file in data/rhythm>`
 * `~/.cabal/bin/solve binding <file in data/binding>`
 * `~/.cabal/bin/solve occlusion <file in data/binding>`
 * `~/.cabal/bin/solve walker [predict/retrodict/impute] <world-id>`

## Understanding the output of the solve process

When solve is run, it produces...
* the theory *θ = (φ, I, R, C)* composed of...
    * the initial conditions (*I*)
    * the rules (*R*)
    * the constraints (*C*)
* the trace (*τ(θ)*)
* statistics: the cost of the interpretation *θ*
* accuracy: whether or not all the predicted sensor readings match the hidden readings

To generate a latex-readable description of the output:
 * set `flag_output_latex = True` in Interpretation.hs
 * recompile: `scripts/compile_solve.sh`
 * run again

## Data generation

The data is already provided in the `data/` folder.

But if you want to regenerate it:
* `scripts/compile_all.sh`
* `cd code`
* `./eca all`
* `./sw all`
* `./music all`
* `./rhythm all`
